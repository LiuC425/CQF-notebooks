# Certificate-in-Quantitative-Finance (CQF)
This repository contains 4 Jupyter Notebooks developed while studing for the Certificate in Quantitative Finance.
The files are possible solutions to assignments. They are published for the **reference purpose** only.
I hope you don't copy any part of the code to pursue your CQF designation. Besides, the files are not the ones were submitted but rather (raw) drafts.
