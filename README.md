# Certificate-in-Quantitative-Finance (CQF)
This repository contains 4 Jupyter Notebooks ((!) drafts) that were developed while studing for the Certificate in Quantitative Finance.
The files are possible solutions, which are only for your **reference purpose**. It may help you save some time as the CQF program is comprehensive.
And I hope you don't copy any part of the code to pursue your CQF designation.
