# Certificate-in-Quantitative-Finance (CQF)
This repository stores 4 Jupyter Notebooks (drafts) that were developed while studing for the Certificate in Quantitative Finance.
Here I released the possible solutions, which are only for your **reference purpose**. It may help you save some time as the CQF program is comprehensive.
And I hope you don't copy any part of the code.
